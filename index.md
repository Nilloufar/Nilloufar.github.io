## <span id="about-me">About Me</span>


I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) of [Michigan State University (MSU)](https://msu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Mohammad Ghassemi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SXGVLXQAAAAJ&hl=en).  

## <span id="research-interests"> Research Interests </span>
I am interested in leveraging human and artificial intelligence to build innovative and safe methods to solve complex problems in domains where human decision-making is critical. My primary research focus is offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) and sequence modeling with applications in sequential decision-making, computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Additionally, I am interested in utilizing foundational models for facilitating the learning process in these domains.
