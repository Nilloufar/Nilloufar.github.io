## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) of [Michigan State University (MSU)](https://msu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Mohammad Ghassemi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SXGVLXQAAAAJ&hl=en).  

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the fields of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and computer vision. My primary research focus is offline RL and sequence modeling. More specifically I am interested in leveraging human and artificial intelligence to build innovative and safe methods that solve complex problems in domains where human decision-making plays a critical role. Additionally, I am interested in utilizing foundational models as effective tools for facilitating the learning process in these domains.
